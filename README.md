# Project Title: WasteSmart

# Overview
This is an innovation to recycle plastic waste designed by using computer vision and React Native for environmental protection. The importance of this is to incentivize the collection and sorting of plastic waste to reduce pollution and foster sustainable waste management for Kenyan youth. 

# Project scope 
It includes an AI-powered image recognition feature integrated with a scanner on the smart-bins that helps users identify and
sort plastic types, a mobile wallet and rewards system, a map of
recycling hubs and collection points, reports for environmental impact tracking,
recycling articles and blogs and updates on waste management and sustainability and a chatbot
assistant to provide useful data on recycling areas and hacks. The expected outcome is to create a basic version of the app with AI image recognition
and map integration and collaborating with telecom providers.
